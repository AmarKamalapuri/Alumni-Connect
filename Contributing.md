# ü§ùFirst time contributing? We will help you out. üëç
    GitHub custom open for collaboration
#

## Installing Git

The first step to starting to contribute is installing Git Bash. You can also use Github Desktop, but using Bash is recommended. This is because Bash allows the user to perform more commands as compared to the latter. After downloading, you need to log into Git Bash using your GitHub credentials.

[Download Git Bash for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

[Download Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

[Download Git Bash for Linux/UNIX](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

## Refer to the following articles on the basics of Git and Github and can also contact the Project Mentors, in case you are stuck:

[Getting started with Git and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github)

[Forking and Cloning a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) 

[How to create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request)

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git).

## üí• How to Contribute

PRs Welcome Open Source Love

Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your own Issues!

Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.

Fork the Repo and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working upon.

Read the Code of Conduct

Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.
Add Screenshots to help us know what this Script is all about.

## ‚≠êHOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST:
## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-alonzo-church
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"
```

replacing `<your-name>` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.
