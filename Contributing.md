GitHub custom open for collaboration

Installing Git
The first step to starting to contribute is installing Git Bash. You can also use Github Desktop, but using Bash is recommended. This is because Bash allows the user to perform more commands as compared to the latter. After downloading, you need to log into Git Bash using your GitHub credentials.

[Download Git Bash for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
[Download Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
[Download Git Bash for Linux/UNIX](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

Refer to the following articles on the basics of Git and Github and can also contact the Project Mentors, in case you are stuck:

[Getting started with Git and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github)
[Forking and Cloning a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) 
[How to create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request)
If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git).
